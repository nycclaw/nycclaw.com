# NYC Claw — Full Context

> In-person AI assistant setup for NYC executives, powered by OpenClaw.

## What is NYC Claw?

NYC Claw is a service that deploys OpenClaw — an open-source AI assistant platform — directly on clients' devices. We handle all the technical configuration so executives can use AI immediately without touching a terminal or managing API keys.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source AI assistant that connects to every major AI provider:
- OpenAI (ChatGPT/GPT-4)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- xAI (Grok)
- Ollama and other local models

Unlike using a single AI provider, OpenClaw lets users switch between models, keeps data private (self-hosted/local-first), and integrates with email, calendar, and workflows.
